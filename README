This hierarchy contains the canonical sources for the "GNU Coding
Standards" and "Information for GNU Maintainers" documents.  All changes
must be approved by rms.

Formatted versions are on the GNU web site: http://www.gnu.org/prep/

Copies of these sources are maintained in the gnulib project
(http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib) for convenience of the
maintainers who already check out gnulib.

If you're interested in these, you might also be interested in the
additional "Gnits" standards.  They are completely unofficial and no
longer updated, but go into somewhat more detail in some areas.  They're
available as part of the GNU Womb:
http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/womb/gnits/ cvs
-d:ext:anoncvs@cvs.gnu.org:/cvsroot/womb co gnits

To update the manuals, see the work.m and work.s directories here.  Each
has a GNUmakefile with assorted targets and comments.  They use the
gendocs.sh script, which is in Texinfo CVS on savannah, which in turn
needs a file gendocs_template, also in Texinfo CVS:
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/texinfo/util/?root=texinfo
