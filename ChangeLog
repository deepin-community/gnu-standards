	* make-stds.texi (Standard Targets) <do-install-info>: Avoid
	absolute, DESTDIR-related, target name, which fails if the target
	directory happens to contain spaces.  Hence avoid $@, which was
	redundantly specified anyway.  Finally, only the install-info run
	is POST_INSTALL, the INSTALL_DATA part is NORMAL_INSTALL.
	Report from Aubrey Jaffer, follow-up from Ralf Wildenhues,
	11 Feb 2010 07:29:15.

	(Directory Variables): State that install dirs and their parents
	should be created before being used.

	describe full purpose of changes" is first discouraged.
	Also, expand the prepositional noun phrase to cover a
	single change.
